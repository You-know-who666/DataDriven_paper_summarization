# DrivenData_paper_summarization

Can you write abstracts for academic social science papers using a large language model that runs on your computer? OK, but can you do it well?

Scientific papers describing research methodology and findings are the gold standard for sharing scientific work. These papers typically start with an abstract that summarizes the entire paper in a single paragraph. Your goal in this practice competition is to generate these abstracts from SocArXiv papers using large language models, or LLMs.

While this task isn't easy to do well, it's easy to start! This is a practice competition designed to be accessible to participants at all levels. That makes it a great place to dive into the world of data science competitions or explore LLMs for the first time.
